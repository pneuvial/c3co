\usage{
getWeightMatrix(prop.max, prob.min, nb.arch, nb.samp, sparse.coeff = 0.5,
  contam.coeff = 0.6, contam.max = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{prop.max}{An integer that is the maximim proportion for a present archetype}

\item{prob.min}{An integer that is the minimum proportion  for a present archetype}

\item{nb.arch}{An interger that is the number of archetypes (number of columns)}

\item{nb.samp}{An interger that is the number of samples (number of rows)}

\item{sparse.coeff}{A numeric between 0 and 1 that control the sparsity by rows}

\item{contam.coeff}{A numeric between 0 and 1 that control the contamination level}

\item{contam.max}{An interger between 0 and 100 that controls the maximal level of contamination by normal cells}
}
\value{
A matrix of weights (the sum of rows is equal to 1)
}
