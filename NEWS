Package: c3co
=============

Version: 0.2.6-9001 [2019-02-17]

BUG FIXES:

 o Passing argument 'Rowv' to heatmap.3() that is of class of 'dendrogram'
   would produce error 'length(x) = 2 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)' in
   R-devel with _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_=true.
 

Version: 0.2.6-9000 [2018-03-19]

 o Now loadPSCBSdata() and segmentData() preserve any sample names.
   
 o Add C3coSegmentation class with print() method etc.

 o Using message() everywhere (instead of print()).
 
 o Force normal component in Z.
 
 o Check rank of W.
 
 o Added test scripts.
 
 o segmentData() asserts that all input data use the same set of loci,
   there are no "missing" chromosomes, and that there are at least three
   data points per chromosome.


Version: 0.2.5-9000 [2017-07-30]

 o Added method modelFitStats() for objects of class 'posFused'.
 
 o Added simple test scripts to inst/testScripts.
 
 o Cleanups in fitC3co() (definition of BIC, consistency with log-likelihood).
   analysis. Added corresponding test script.
   
 o Added several flavors for the initialization of Z: svd, NMF, and archetypal 
   analysis. Added corresponding test script.
   
 o Added function getToyData() (and corresponding test script) to generate toy 
   locus-level and segment-level data.


Version: 0.2.4-9000 [2017-07-24]

 o In fitC3co(): the model is now applied on centered data.
 
 o buildSubclone() can now also generate purely simulated data if no real data
   are given as input.
   

Version: 0.2.3-9000 [2017-06-28]

 o Force Z1 <= Z2.
 
 o Bugs fixed for W set type=2 in limSolve::lsei().


Version: 0.2.2-9000 [2017-05-17]

 o Changed structure of c3co object by adding 'config' slot.
 
 o Bugs fixed for Z inference when (WtW)^-1 is non-inversible.
 

Version: 0.2.1-9000 [2017-04-20]

 o Removed conditions c1 and c2 in fitC3co().
 
 o Changed generation of weight matrix (new function rSparseWeightMatrix()).
 
 o Set lambda1=lambda2 for Minor and Major inference by default.


Version: 0.2.0-9000 [2017-04-12]

 o Changed default grid of values for penalization parameters: now ranges
   uniformly *on the log scale* over the interval.
   
 o More code cleanups.


Version: 0.2.0 [2017-03-31]

CODE REFACTORING:

 o More code cleanups.
 
 o Added minimal sanity checks for some function arguments.
 
 o Added function initializeZ() so that the initialization is
   performed only once per candidate number of subclones in 'c3co'.
   
 o In class 'posFused', ddded slot 'S0' to store initial estimates of Z
 
 o Moved function get.Z.new() into get.Z()
 
 o Added function fitC3co() that performs the actual fitting from segment-level
   data. This function is called by the main function c3co().


Version: 0.1.15 [2017-03-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 o createZdf() now handles multiple chromosomes and statistics.

 o plotZ() now handles multiple chromosomes and statistics.

CODE REFACTORING:

 o Some code cleanups.


Version: 0.1.14 [2017-03-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 o The genotypes of the subclones produced by buildSubclones() now have the
   same distribution as the input data (before, it was 1/3,1/3,1/3 regardless
   of the input data).

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o Added tests of consistency of the output of buildSubclones().

CODE REFACTORING:

 o Back to using base::Reduce() instead of purrr::map_df().

 o Some code cleanups.



Version: 0.1.13 [2017-03-13]

CODE REFACTORING:
