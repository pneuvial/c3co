Package: c3co
=============

Version: 0.2.5-9000 [2017-07-25]

 o Added several flavors for the initialization of Z: svd, NMF, and archetypal 
 analysis. Added corresponding test script.
 o Added function 'getToyData' (and corresponding test script) to generate toy 
 locus-level and segment-level data.

Version: 0.2.4-9000 [2017-07-24]

 o In 'fitC3co': the model is now applied on centered data
 o 'buildSubclone' can now also generate purely simulated data if no real data are given as input

Version: 0.2.3-9000 [2017-06-28]

 o Force Z1<=Z2
 o Bugs fixed for W set type=2 in lsei

Version: 0.2.2-9000 [2017-05-17]

 o Changed structure of c3co object by adding 'config' slot
 o Bugs fixed for Z inferrence when (WtW)^-1 is non-inversible

Version: 0.2.1-9000 [2017-04-20]

 o Removed conditions c1 and c2 in fitc3co
 o Changed generation of weight matrix (new function rSparseWeightMatrix)
 o Set lambda1=lambda2 for Minor and Major inference by default


Version: 0.2.0-9000 [2017-04-12]

 o Changed default grid of values for penalization parameters: now ranges
   uniformly *on the log scale* over the interval.
 o More code cleanups


Version: 0.2.0 [2017-03-31]

CODE REFACTORING:

 o More code cleanups
 o Added minimal sanity checks for some function arguments
 o Added function 'initializeZ' so that the initialization is
   performed only once per candidate number of subclones in 'c3co'
 o In class 'posFused', ddded slot 'S0' to store initial estimates of Z
 o Moved function 'get.Z.new' into 'get.Z'
 o Added function 'fitC3co' that performs the actual fitting
   from segment-level data. This function is called by the
   main function 'c3co'

Version: 0.1.15 [2017-03-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 o 'createZdf' now handles multiple chromosomes and statistics

 o 'plotZ' now handles multiple chromosomes and statistics

CODE REFACTORING:

 o Some code cleanups


Version: 0.1.14 [2017-03-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 o The genotypes of the subclones produced by 'buildSubclones' now have the
   same distribution as the input data (before, it was 1/3,1/3,1/3 regardless
   of the input data)

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o Added tests of consistency of the output of 'buildSubclones'

CODE REFACTORING:

 o Back to using 'base::Reduce' instead of 'purrr::map_df'

 o Some code cleanups



Version: 0.1.13 [2017-03-13]
