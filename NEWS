Package: c3co
=============

Version: 0.2.6-9001 [2019-02-18]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Renamed argument 'Z' of positiveFusedLasso() to 'Zt' to clarify that the
   input is the transpose of matrix 'Z'. Same for internal internal get.W().

 * Renamed initializeZ() to initializeZt() to clarify that it returns the
   transpose of matrix 'Z'.  Same for internal get.Z() renamed to get.Zt().

NEW FEATURES:

 * loadFacetsdata() gained argument 'pattern'.

 * getToyData() gained arguments 'dimension' and 'returnLocus'.
 
 * In 'getToyData', replaced argument 'nbBkps' by 'nbSegs' (= nbBkps+1)
   for notation consistency.

 
BUG FIXES:

 * Passing argument 'Rowv' to heatmap.3() that is of class of 'dendrogram'
   would produce error 'length(x) = 2 > 1' in coercion to 'logical(1)' in
   R-devel with _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_=true.

 * Generic trackNames() called NextMethod() instead of UseMethod().
 
 * In  'getToyData', robustified the creation of Z so that it is full rank
 * In 'getToyData', robustified the creation of W so all row sum to 1 and all
   items are in [0,1].
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Add first tests for get.W().

 * Add help pages with examples to internal get.W() and get.Z() functions.
 
 * Add sanity checks and tests for getLocusData(). 
 
Version: 0.2.6-9000 [2018-03-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now loadPSCBSdata() and segmentData() preserve any sample names.
   
 * Add C3coSegmentation class with print() method etc.

 * Using message() everywhere (instead of print()).
 
 * Force normal component in Z.
 
 * Check rank of W.
 
 * segmentData() asserts that all input data use the same set of loci,
   there are no "missing" chromosomes, and that there are at least three
   data points per chromosome.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added test scripts.
 

Version: 0.2.5-9000 [2017-07-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added method modelFitStats() for objects of class 'posFused'.
 
 * Cleanups in fitC3co() (definition of BIC, consistency with log-likelihood).
   analysis. Added corresponding test script.
   
 * Added several flavors for the initialization of Z: svd, NMF, and archetypal 
   analysis. Added corresponding test script.
   
 * Added function getToyData() (and corresponding test script) to generate toy 
   locus-level and segment-level data.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added simple test scripts to inst/testScripts.
 


Version: 0.2.4-9000 [2017-07-24]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * In fitC3co(): the model is now applied on centered data.
 
NEW FEATURES:

 * buildSubclone() can now also generate purely simulated data if no real data
   are given as input.
   

Version: 0.2.3-9000 [2017-06-28]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Force Z1 <= Z2.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * Bugs fixed for W set type=2 in limSolve::lsei().


Version: 0.2.2-9000 [2017-05-17]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Changed structure of c3co object by adding 'config' slot.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * Bugs fixed for Z inference when (WtW)^-1 is non-inversible.
 

Version: 0.2.1-9000 [2017-04-20]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Removed conditions c1 and c2 in fitC3co().
 
 * Changed generation of weight matrix (new function rSparseWeightMatrix()).
 
 * Set lambda1=lambda2 for Minor and Major inference by default.


Version: 0.2.0-9000 [2017-04-12]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Changed default grid of values for penalization parameters: now ranges
   uniformly *on the log scale* over the interval.
   
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * More code cleanups.


Version: 0.2.0 [2017-03-31]

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Added function initializeZ() so that the initialization is
   performed only once per candidate number of subclones in 'c3co'.
   
 * In class 'posFused', added slot 'S0' to store initial estimates of Z
 
 * Moved function get.Z.new() into get.Z()
 
 * Added function fitC3co() that performs the actual fitting from segment-level
   data. This function is called by the main function c3co().

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * More code cleanups.
 
 * Added minimal sanity checks for some function arguments.
 

Version: 0.1.15 [2017-03-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * createZdf() now handles multiple chromosomes and statistics.

 * plotZ() now handles multiple chromosomes and statistics.

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Some code cleanups.


Version: 0.1.14 [2017-03-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * The genotypes of the subclones produced by buildSubclones() now have the
   same distribution as the input data (before, it was 1/3,1/3,1/3 regardless
   of the input data).

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added tests of consistency of the output of buildSubclones().

CODE REFACTORING:

 * Back to using base::Reduce() instead of purrr::map_df().

 * Some code cleanups.



Version: 0.1.13 [2017-03-13]
